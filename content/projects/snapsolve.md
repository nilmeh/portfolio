## Overview

A civic engagement iOS application developed during LA Hacks 2025 that empowers citizens to report infrastructure issues using AI-powered image recognition for automatic issue classification and priority assessment.

## Key Features

- **Smart Issue Detection**: AI analyzes photos to identify infrastructure problems
- **Automatic Classification**: Categorizes issues (potholes, broken lights, graffiti, etc.)
- **GPS Integration**: Precise location tracking for accurate reporting
- **Priority Assessment**: AI determines urgency level based on image analysis
- **Real-time Reporting**: Instant submission to city management systems
- **Progress Tracking**: Users can follow resolution status of their reports

## Technical Implementation

- **Mobile App**: SwiftUI with native iOS features and smooth animations
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API with RESTful endpoints
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible document storage
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for advanced image analysis
- **Location Services**: Core Location for precise GPS coordinates
- **Image Processing**: On-device optimization before cloud analysis

## AI Capabilities

- **Computer Vision**: Identifies 15+ types of infrastructure issues
- **Severity Assessment**: Rates urgency from 1-10 based on visual analysis
- **Context Understanding**: Considers surrounding environment in assessment
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides accuracy metrics for each detection

## Hackathon Achievement

- **LA Hacks 2025**: Successfully completed 36-hour development sprint
- **Team Collaboration**: Coordinated with designers and backend developers
- **Rapid Prototyping**: MVP development and testing within time constraints
- **Pitch Presentation**: Demonstrated to judges and fellow hackers

## Impact & Vision

- **Civic Engagement**: Simplifies citizen participation in city improvement
- **Efficiency**: Reduces manual categorization work for city staff
- **Accountability**: Creates transparent tracking system for public issues
- **Scalability**: Designed to work across multiple municipalities

## Technical Challenges

1. **Real-time Processing**: Balancing AI accuracy with response time
2. **Battery Optimization**: Efficient use of GPS and camera resources
3. **Offline Capability**: Queuing reports when network unavailable
4. **Data Privacy**: Ensuring location and image data protection

## Future Enhancements

- **City Integration**: Direct API connections with municipal systems
- **Community Features**: Voting and discussion on reported issues
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Insights for city planners and officials
- **Multi-platform**: Android version and web dashboard
